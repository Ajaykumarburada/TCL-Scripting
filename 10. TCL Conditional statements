TCL- Decisions (or) control structures:

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be 
executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

 1. if statement 
 2. if else statement
 3. if elseif statement
 4. nested statement
 5. Switch statement
 6. Nested Switch statement

 1. if statement :
       An ‘if’ statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
syntax:
        if {condition} {
            body of if statement is execute condition is true
        }

Example:
      set a 10
      #check the boolean condition using if statement
      if { $a < 20 } {
       # if condition is true then print the following 
       puts "a is less than 20"
      }
      puts "value of a is : $a

2. if else statement:
      An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
syntax:
        if {condition} {
       body of if statement is execute condition is true
       } else {
       body of else statement is execute condition is false
       }
       
Example:
      set a 100
      #check the boolean condition 
      if {$a < 20 } {
       #if condition is true then print the following 
       puts "a is less than 20"
      } else {
       #if condition is false then print the following 
       puts "a is not less than 20"
      }
      puts "value of a is : $a"

3. if elseif statement:
    An ‘if’ statement can be followed by an optional else if...else statement, which is very useful to test various conditions using single if...else if statement.
syntax:
      if {condition 1} {
       body of if statement is executed when condition 1 is true
       } elseif {condtion 2} {
       body of elseif statement is executed when condition is true & above condition 1 is false
       } else {
       body of else is executed when above both condition 1 & condition 2 is false
       }
Example:
      set a 100
      #check the boolean condition
      if { $a == 10 } {
       # if condition is true then print the following 
       puts "Value of a is 10"
      } elseif { $a == 20 } {
       # if else if condition is true 
       puts "Value of a is 20"
      } elseif { $a == 30 } {
       # if else if condition is true 
       puts "Value of a is 30"
      } else {
      # if none of the conditions is true 
       puts "None of the values is matching"
      }
      puts "Exact value of a is: $a"

4. Nested if statement:
      It is always legal in Tcl to nest if-else statements, which means you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
syntax:
      if {condition 1} {
        this condition 1 is executed when it is true
          if {condition 2} {
            this condition 2 is executed when it is true
          }
        }
Example:
      set a 100
      set b 200
      # check the boolean condition 
      if { $a == 100 } {
       # if condition is true then check the following 
       if { $b == 200 } {
       #if condition is true then print the following 
       puts "Value of a is 100 and b is 200"
       }
      }
      puts "Exact value of a is : $a"
      puts "Exact value of b is : $b"

5. Switch statement:
    A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. 
    Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case.
syntax:
      switch {condition} {
       "case1" {
       body of the case1
       }
       "case2" {
       body of the case2
       }
       "case3" {
       body of the case3
       }
       deafult {
       body of the dafault
       }
     }
Example:
      set grade C
      switch $grade {
      A { 
      puts "Well done!" 
      }
      B { 
      puts "Excellent!" 
      } 
      C {
      puts "You passed!" 
      } 
      F { 
      puts "Better try again" 
      } 
      default {
      puts "Invalid grade" 
      }
    }
      puts "Your grade is $grade"

6. Nested switch statement:
    It is possible to have a switch as part of the statement sequence of an outer switch.
    Evenif the case constants of the inner and outer switch contain common values, no conflicts will arise.
syntax:
      switch {condition 1} {
             "case1" {
             body of the case1
             }
          switch {condition 2}
             "case2" {
             body of the case2
             }
             "case3" {
             body of the case3
             }
             deafult {
             body of the dafault
             }
           }
Example:
      set a 100
      set b 200
      switch $a {
       100 {
       puts "This is part of outer switch"
       switch $b {
       200 {
       puts "This is part of inner switch!"
       }
      }
       } 
      }
      puts "Exact value of a is : $a"
      puts "Exact value of a is : $b"
