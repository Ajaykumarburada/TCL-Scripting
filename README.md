# TCL-Scripting
Physical Design

Tcl is shortened form of Tool Command Language. John Ousterhout of the University of California, Berkeley, designed it. 
It is a combination of a scripting language and its own interpreter that gets embedded to the application, we develop with it.
Tcl was developed initially for Unix. It was then ported to Windows, DOS, OS/2, and Mac OSX. 
Tcl is much similar to other unix shell languages like Bourne Shell (Sh), the C Shell (csh), the Korn Shell (sh), and Perl.
It aims at providing ability for programs to interact with other programs and also for acting as an embeddable interpreter.
Even though, the original aim was to enable programs to interact, you can find full-fledged applications written in Tcl/Tk.
