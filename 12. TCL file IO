TCL File I/O handling:
    Tcl supports file handling with the help of the built in commands open, read, puts, gets, and close.
    A file represents a sequence of bytes, does not matter if it is a text file or binary file.

1. Opening files:
    Tcl uses the open command to open files in Tcl.
syntax:
      open fileName accessMode
      
Mode Description:
r
    Opens an existing text file for reading purpose and the file must exist. 
    This is the default mode used when no accessMode is specified.
    
w
    Opens a text file for writing, if it does not exist, then a new file is created else existing file is truncated.

a
    Opens a text file for writing in appending mode and file must exist. 
    Here, your program will start appending content in the existing file content.

r+ 
    Opens a text file for reading and writing both. File must exist already.

w+
    Opens a text file for reading and writing both. It first truncate the file to zero 
    length if it exists otherwise create the file if it does not exist.

a+
    Opens a text file for reading and writing both. It creates the file if it does not 
    exist. The reading will start from the beginning, but writing can only be appended.

2. closing a file:
    To close a file, use the close command.
    Any file that has been opened by a program must be closed when the program finishes using that file.
syntax:
    close filename

3. writing a file:
    Puts command is used to write to an open file.
syntax:
      puts $filename "text to write"
Example:
      set fp [open "input.txt" w+]
      puts $fp "test"
      close $fp

4. Reading a file:
syntax:
      set file_data [read $fp]
Example 1:
      set fp [open "input.txt" w+]
      puts $fp "test"
      close $fp
      set fp [open "input.txt" r]
      set file_data [read $fp]
      puts $file_data
      close $fp
Example 2: reading file till end of file line by line.
        set fp [open "input.txt" w+]
        puts $fp "test\ntest"
        close $fp
        set fp [open "input.txt" r]
        while { [gets $fp data] >= 0 } {
         puts $data
        }
        close $fp
