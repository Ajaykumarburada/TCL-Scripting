Operators:

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. 
Tcl language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following 
types of operators:
  1. uninary operators
  2. binary operators
  3. terinary operators

1. Uninary operators:
  In this we have only one operand 
Increment(+5),decrement(-1) ,logical not(!) and Bitwise(~) operators

2. Binary operators:
    1.Arithmetic operators :- {+, -, *, /, % , **} 
    2.Relational operators :- {> , < ,<=,>=,==,!=}
    3.Logical operators :- && ,||
    4.bitwise operators :- (bit wise and)&, | (or) , ^(xor) , ~&(nand) , ~|(nor) , ~^ (xnor)
    5.shift operators :- >> (right shift) ,<< (left shift)
      In right shift number div by 2**n
      In left shift num mul by 2**n
      
3. Terinary operators:
   (condition) ? true expression :false expression


****   Example of Arithemetic operator ****

set a 21
set b 10
set c [expr $a + $b]
puts "Line 1 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a - $b]
puts "Line 2 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a * $b]
puts "Line 3 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a / $b]
puts "Line 4 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a % $b]
puts "Line 5 - Value of c is $c\n"

**** Example of Relational operator ****

Example 1:
set a 10
set b 10

if {[expr $a == $b]} {
    puts "a is equal to b\n"
} else {
puts "Line 1 - a is not equal to b\n"
}
if { $a < $b } {
puts "Line 2 - a is less than b\n"
} else {
puts "Line 2 - a is not less than b\n"
}
if { $a > $b } {
puts "Line 3 - a is greater than b\n"
} else {
puts "Line 3 - a is not greater than b\n"
}

Example 2:
set a 5
set b 20
if { $a <= $b } {
puts "Line 4 - a is either less than or equal to b\n"
}
if { $b >= $a } {
puts "Line 5 - b is either greater than or equal to b\n"
}

**** Example of Logical operator ****

set a 5
set b 20
if { $a && $b } {
 puts "Line 1 - Condition is true\n"
}
if { $a || $b } {
puts "Line 2 - Condition is true\n"
}
# lets change the value of a and b 
set a 0
set b 10
if { $a && $b } {
puts "Line 3 - Condition is true\n"
} else {
puts "Line 3 - Condition is not true\n"
}
if { !($a && $b) } {
puts "Line 4 - Condition is true\n"
}

**** Bitwise operators ****

set a 60 ;# 60 = 0011 1100 
set b 13 ;# 13 = 0000 1101
set c [expr $a & $b] ;# 12 = 0000 1100
puts "Line 1 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a | $b;] ;# 61 = 0011 1101
puts "Line 2 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a ^ $b;] ;# 49 = 0011 0001
puts "Line 3 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a << 2] ;# 240 = 1111 0000
puts "Line 4 - Value of c is $c\n"
set c [expr $a >> 2] ;# 15 = 0000 1111
puts "Line 5 - Value of c is $c\n"

**** Terinary operator ****

set a 10;
set b [expr $a == 1 ? 20: 30]
puts "Value of b is $b\n"
set b [expr $a == 10 ? 20: 30]
puts "Value of b is $b\n"


Example 

set a 20
set b 10
set c 15
set d 5
set e [expr [expr $a + $b] * $c / $d ] ;# ( 30 * 15 ) / 5
puts "Value of (a + b) * c / d is : $e\n"
set e [expr [expr [expr $a + $b] * $c] / $d] ;# (30 * 15 ) / 5]
puts "Value of ((a + b) * c) / d is : $e\n"
set e [expr [expr $a + $b] * [expr $c / $d] ] ;# (30) * (15/5)
puts "Value of (a + b) * (c / d) is : $e\n"
set e [expr $a + [expr $b * $c ] / $d ] ;# 20 + (150/5)
puts "Value of a + (b * c) / d is : $e\n"
